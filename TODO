TODO:

* Improve the applescript, such that it searches Terminal.app for Python instances, and switches to the correct tab. If this is possible!.
* Investigate some kind of communication with IPython. Is is possible to make the bundle aware of IPython's current state?
* Learn about and implement useful '%' (magic) commands.
