IPython Bundle Todo List:
-------------------------

* Using the socket based server (ipy_vimserver.y). How can I make the connection persistent, so that:

    1. TM doesn't have to ask which session to connect to more that once 
    (see plistlib.py?/pickle?)
    - or -
    2. I don't have to reconnect each time

* Modify ipy_vimserver.py to return status messages via the socket. That way we might know when the commands have finished running.
* Find out how to add server-run commands to the history (if they really aren't already).
* Find out how to get IPython to draw another prompt after running a remote command.
    
* Improve the applescript, such that it searches Terminal.app for Python instances, and switches to the correct tab. If this is possible!.
* Learn about and implement useful '%' (magic) commands.

# Syntax

* Work out how to include `source.python` in the relevant bits of the config syntax.

# Snippets

* Add useful ipython related snippets. These could include pylab/scipy/numpy access or other related modules.
